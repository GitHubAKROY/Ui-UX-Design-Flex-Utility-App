This project focuses on designing a smart utility app for Amazon Flex drivers. The design improves user workflow by providing a clean dashboard, real-time task tracking, delivery summaries, earnings overview, and useful shortcuts. The goal was to create a simple, fast, and intuitive experience that helps drivers manage their daily operations more efficiently.

The UI/UX process included user research, wireframing, prototyping, and visual design using Figma. The app layout is focused on clarity, usability, and smooth user interaction.
